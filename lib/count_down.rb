# Write your code here
=begin
while (condition expression)
do 
body
end
As long as the condition of the expression is true, or truthy, the do..end block will run. Keep in mind, as an expression of the caondition expression can be quite rich using conditional operators && || ()
Writing an infinite loop:
while true do 
puts "Say tis forever"
end
=end
